{{ .Description | trimspace }}

{{ if .HasExample -}}
## Example Usage

{{tffile .ExampleFile }}
{{- end }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Limitations

- `container`, `endpoint` and `env` blocks have to sorted by `name`. You'll need to follow the same order on your .tf files, otherwise terraform will show them as modified after an `apply`;
- Renaming a `container`, `endpoint` or `env` will cause the plan to show unrelated items being modified, as their order jumps up or down. We recommend deleting the block, applying, and then adding the block again with the new name;
- Renaming an `endpoint` of type CDN may cause pullzones to be recreated, even if they aren't directly affected;

{{- if .HasImport }}

## Import

{{codefile "shell" .ImportFile }}
{{- end }}
